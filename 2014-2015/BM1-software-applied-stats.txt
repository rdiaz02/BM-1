 BM-1: Software for the "Applied Stastics" part
 ===============================================


 You will all have access to a computer (running the Windows operating
 system) with all the software. However, you probably want to install the
 software on your own computer at home. If you plan to bring your own
 laptop to class, then you definitely MUST install the software before our
 first day of class.

 The following are the installation instructions and information. It is
 best if you do the installation in this order and, please, do follow
 carefully. If you have questions or problems AND you have followed the
 instructions carefully, post your questions, with detailed information of
 the errors or problems in the Applied Statistics forum.



 1. Install R (http://cran.r-project.org). The binaries for each operating
     system are available here: http://cran.r-project.org/bin/

     1.1. For Linux, most distros have pre-built binaries, so with Debian
     use apt-get install r-base r-base-dev, with Fedora and RH yum install
     whatever, etc. There are instructions in the CRAN page if you need
     them, though, for many distros.

     However, if you use Ubuntu, please read the instructions in
     http://cran.r-project.org/bin/linux/ubuntu/README.html, since the
     default Ubuntu packages can be  outdated.

     
     1.2. If you use Windows, you want to install "base". It says so
     clearly: "Binaries for base distribution (managed by Duncan
     Murdoch). This is what you want to install R for the first time."

     
     1.3. If you use Mac, if you play with installation options, note that
     you need to install the tcl/Tk X11 libraries. If you run into trouble,
     make sure to read the FAQ
     (http://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/RMacOSX-FAQ.html).


     1.4. However you do it, please make sure you have version 3.1.1 of R
     (if you know what you are doing, it is also OK to use development
     versions). Any version of R >= 3.0.0 should work, but it is best if
     you use a current one.

     

 2. Install R commander.

    There are installation instructions here:
    http://socserv.mcmaster.ca/jfox/Misc/Rcmdr/installation-notes.html


    This is the summary, which should work for all operating systems (and will
    install all dependencies)

    2.1. Start R

    2.2. Copy and paste the following in the console:


    install.packages("Rcmdr")


    Press Enter.

    It might tell you (depending on operating systems and other settings)
    that the system library is not writable, and will ask you if you want
    to install to a personal library. Say yes.
    
    It will ask your for a mirror. If you are in Madrid, the one in Madrid
    is the best. If, for some reason, that is down, then choose another
    (e.g., France or Switzerland).


    2.3. When it is finished, in the R console do:
       
     library(Rcmdr)

     Press Enter. It will tell you there are missing dependencies ("The
     following packages used by Rcmdr are missing ...") and it will offer
     to install them. Allow it to install all the missing dependencies
     (the defaults in the window of "Install Missing Packages" should be
     fine; no need to touch anything; just press OK). This should take a
     couple minutes.


    2.4. Users of Mac: there are sometimes issues with Rcmdr if, say, X11
    is missing. Read the installation instructions for R commander given
    above.



    2.5. Please, try to use version 2.1-1 of Rcmdr. How can you tell the
    version? Two ways:

    2.5.1 From R itself do "library(help  = Rcmdr)" and it will procude
    output that includes the Version number.

    2.5.1. From Rcmdr itself: go to "Help" and click on "About Rcmdr"



    2.6. Linux: some Linux distros ship pre-compiled versions of Rcmdr. So
    you might install Rmcdr this way. But beware that some Linux distros
    ship versions of Rcmdr that can be very outdated.

	

    2.7. Does the version of Rcmdr matter? Not a lot (assuming it is
    anything > 2.0), but newer versions have more functionality. And yes,
    those in the class computers will use v. 2.0-4, not 2.1.1.
    

   
    
 3. Install a few R commander plugins.

    3.1. In the same R console (the R console, not the R commander window
    ---the R console is the console or window that oppened first when you
    started R, and it says "R console" at the top) session as before, copy
    and paste

    install.packages(c("RcmdrPlugin.TeachingDemos",
   "RcmdrPlugin.survival", "RcmdrPlugin.sos" , "RcmdrPlugin.HH",
   "RcmdrPlugin.mosaic", "RcmdrPlugin.plotByGroup", 
   "tkrplot", "doBy"))


    and press Enter. That will download and install a few things (it
    should be done in a couple of minutes).


    3.2. Exit R Commander and R. Under "File", in "R Commander", click on
    "Exit", and in there on "Exit From Commander and R"
   


 4. Install RStudio (www.rstudio.com). We want to use the "Dektop", that
    you can download from here:

    http://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/	


 
    4.1. Install RStudio. RStudio has new releases almost daily, but
    anything with version 0.98.945 should be more than enough.

    4.2. Verify it works. Click on it and it should start, and you should
    see an application with an R console (along with two or three other
    windows)

   

    4.3. Make sure everything works including R commander.

     4.3.1 In RStudio, go to the R console (the left panel or the
         bottom-left panel) and type
         library("Rcmdr")
 	
     4.3.2 Press enter.
       You should see a new window that says "R Commander", and no warning
       messages about missing dependencies.

     4.3.3.If there are still missing dependencies, you should be given the
       option to install them by just clicking a button. Do so now.


       
       

       
5. Install RcmdrPlugin.doBy.

    This is a nice plugin that used to be available (though with at least
    one bug) but that was moved out of the CRAN repository on
    2014-08-20. I have fixed the bug, and you can get the fixed version
    from Moodle. Install it this way:

     5.1 Download the file from Moodle: RmcdrPlugin.doBy_0.1-4.tar.gz.
     (Beware that, after download, some operating systems that want to
     outsmart you might hide the extension ---tar.gz--). Remember where
     your web browser (IE, Firefox, Google Chrome, Safari, whatever)
     leaves the file.
    

     5.2 In RStudio go to ``Tools'', ``Install Packages''.

     5.3 In the entry ``Install from'', select ``Package Archive File''

     5.4 In the second entry, ``Package archive'', select the file you
       got (RcmdrPlugin.doBy_0.1-4.tar.gz). You will need to know (or
       find) where your web browser left the file.

     5.5 Install
   

       
6. Exit R Studio, RCommander, etc.

   6.1. In R Commander, go to "File", "Exit", "From commander"

   6.2. In RStudio go to "File", "Quit RStudio".

   6.3. (There are other ways of exiting, like simply going to RStudio and
    in the "File" menu clicking on "Quit R Studio". This looks abrupt and
    in Windows can give you worrying messages, but it is OK. Similar
    things can be done directly from R Commander, by exiting from "From
    Commander and R").


  6.4. If you get questions about "Save workspace image" just say "No".


7. Double check things work:

   7.1 Start RStudio.
   
   7.2 On the left or bottom-left panel type
       library(Rcmdr)

   7.3 When you get R Commander running, go to the menu and under "Tools",
   "Load Rcmdr plugin(s)" select all of them.

   7.4. You will get a message that says that the plugin will not be
   available until the Commander is restarted. Click Yes to restart the
   Commander.

   7.5. If everything worked, you can now exit. If things did not, retrace
   your steps or start all over and follow instructions carefully.
