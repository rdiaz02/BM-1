 BM-1: Software for the "Applied Stastics" part
 ===============================================


 You will all have access to a computer (running the Windows operating
 system) with all the software. However, you probably want to install the
 software on your own computer at home. If you plan to bring your own
 laptop to class, then you definitely MUST install the software before our
 first day of class.

 The following are the installation instructions and information. It is
 best if you do the installation in this order (and, please, do follow
 carefully)



 1. Install R (http://cran.r-project.org). The binaries for each operating
     system are available here: http://cran.r-project.org/bin/

     1.1. If you use Ubuntu, please read the instructions in
     http://cran.r-project.org/bin/linux/ubuntu/README.html, since the
     default Ubuntu packages are generally outdated.

     1.2. If you use Windows, you want to install "base". It says so
     clearly: "Binaries for base distribution (managed by Duncan
     Murdoch). This is what you want to install R for the first time."

     1.3. If you use Mac, if you play with installation options, note that
     you need to install the tcl/Tk X11 libraries. If you run into trouble,
     make sure to read the FAQ
     (http://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/RMacOSX-FAQ.html).

     

 2. Install R commander.

    There are installation instructions here:
    http://socserv.mcmaster.ca/jfox/Misc/Rcmdr/installation-notes.html


    This is the summary, which should work for all operating systems (and will
    install all dependencies)

    2.1. Start R

    2.2. Copy and paste the following in the console:


    install.packages("Rcmdr")


    Press Enter. It will ask your for a mirror. If you are in Madrid,
    the one in Madrid is the best. If, for some reason, that is down, then
    choose another (e.g., France or Switzerland).


    2.3. When it is finished, in the R console do:
       
     library(Rcmdr)

     Press Enter. It will tell you there are missing dependencies and it will
     offer to install them. Allow it to install all the missing
     dependencies (the defaults in the window of "Install Missing Packages"
     should be fine; no need to touch anything; just press OK). This should
     take a couple minutes.


    2.4. Users of Mac: there are sometimes issues with Rcmdr if, say, X11
    is missing. Read the installation instructions for R commander given
    above.


   
    
 3. Install a few R commander plugins.

    3.1. In the same R console (the R console, not the R commander window)
    session as before, copy and paste

    install.packages(c("RcmdrPlugin.TeachingDemos",
   "RcmdrPlugin.survival", "RcmdrPlugin.sos" , "RcmdrPlugin.HH",
   "RcmdrPlugin.mosaic", "RcmdrPlugin.plotByGroup", "RcmdrPlugin.doBy",
   "tkrplot"))


   and press Enter. That will download and install a few things (it should
   be done in a couple of minutes).


   

    3.2. Exit R Commander and R. Under "File", in "R Commander", click on "Exit",
    and in there on "Exit From Commander and R"
   


 4. Install R studio (www.rstudio.com). We want to use the "Dektop", that
    you can download from here:

     https://www.rstudio.com/ide/download/desktop


     Once installation is complete, make sure it works.

     4.1. Install R studio.

     4.2. Verify it works. Click on it and it should start, and you should
     see an application with an R console (along with two or three other
     windows)

   

     4.3. Make sure everything works including R commander.

     4.3.1 In the R console in R Studio type
         library("Rcmdr")
 	
     4.3.2 Press enter.
       You should see a new window that says "R Commander", and no warning
       messages about missing dependencies.

     4.3.3.If there are still missing dependencies, you should be given the
       option to install them by just clicking a button. Do so now.


 5. Exit R Studio, RCommander, etc.

    The simplest thing is to go to the R Studio Window and click on the
    "File" menu, and there click on "Quit R Studio".

    (If you get questions about "Save workspace image" just say "No".)
