 BM-1: Software for the "Applied Stastics" part
 ===============================================


 You will all have access to a computer (running the Windows operating
 system) with all the software, but you will need to install some software
 in your computers for the Applied Statistics part. However, due to some
 recent (and possibly ongoing) changes in some packages, we will provide a
 link with the most up-to-date instructions during the presentation on
 22-September.
