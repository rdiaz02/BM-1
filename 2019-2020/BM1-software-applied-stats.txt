 BM-1: Software for the "Applied Stastics" part
 ===============================================


 You need to install software on your own laptop/computer at home. The
 following are the installation instructions and information. Please:

 1. Follow these instructions carefully.
 
 2. Follow the instructions in this order.

 3. Do all of this from a place where you have a reliable and fast
 internet connection. If the connection fails during installation, things
 can become a mess. This is actually the most common cause of problems. 


 If you have problems, repeat the above three steps. Remove everything you
 have installed, and start all over. 

 If you still have problems after that (you shouldn't) post your
 questions, with detailed information (maybe including screen captures) of
 the errors, in the Applied Statistics forum.


Again: PLEASE FOLLOW THESE INSTRUCTIONS CAREFULLY AND EXACTLY AS EXPLAINED.


 1. Install R (http://cran.r-project.org). The binaries for each operating
     system are available here: http://cran.r-project.org/bin/

     1.1. For Linux, most distros have pre-built binaries, so with Debian
     use apt-get install r-base r-base-dev, with Fedora and RH yum install
     whatever, etc. There are instructions in the CRAN page if you need
     them, though, for many distros.

     However, if you use Ubuntu, please read the instructions in
     http://cran.r-project.org/bin/linux/ubuntu/README.html, since the
     default Ubuntu packages can be  outdated.

     
     1.2. If you use Windows, you want to install "base". It says so
     clearly: "Binaries for base distribution (managed by Duncan
     Murdoch). This is what you want to install R for the first time."


     	  1.2.1 After you download R, and right before installing it,
	  you might want to disable the antivirus (some antiviruses lead
	  to all sorts of difficult to diagnose problems and we cannot
	  help with that). 
	  
          1.2.2 When you install R under Windows, and to avoid problems
     	  later (with paths, with permissions, with local language
     	  settings, etc) change the default path. Install R
     	  into
	  
	       C:\R\
	       (so you can have, for instance, C:\R\R-3.6.2)

	  Choosing the installation directory is something you do
     	  immediately after you click accept on the license. It is a
     	  screen that says "Select Destination Location". In there, type
     	  the above path: "C:\R" (without the quotes).

	  Please, REALLY INSTALL TO "C:\R" UNDER WINDOWS. Many people
     	  experience problems when they don't. These problems are
     	  related to permissions and local language settings. Those
     	  are solvable, but we cannot help. So do as we say: install
     	  to "C:\R\R-3.6.2" or deal with the issues on you own.

	  1.2.3. Click on "Install package translations" to make sure you
	  get messages in English and in other languages (Spanish, or
	  whatever).

	  1.2.4. You probably want to check "Create a desktop
	  shortcut" and "Create a Quick Launch shortcut". (And leave
	  as checked the "Save version number in registry" and
	  "Associate R with .RData file").
	  
	  1.2.5. You probably want to check on the "Use the SDI interface"
	  in the preferences of R, right after you start it. Or go to
	  "Edit" -> "GUI Preferences", check "SDI", the "Save...", and
	  close and quit (say "No" to "Save the workspace image" question).

     
     1.3. If you use Mac, if you play with installation options, note that
     you need to install the tcl/Tk X11 libraries. If you run into trouble,
     make sure to read the FAQ
     (http://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/RMacOSX-FAQ.html).


     1.4. Regardless of your operating system, please make sure you have
     version 3.6.2 of R (if you know what you are doing, it is also OK to
     use development versions). Any version of R >= 3.3.0 should work, but
     it is best if you use a current one.


 2. Install R commander.

    There are installation instructions here:
    http://socserv.mcmaster.ca/jfox/Misc/Rcmdr/installation-notes.html


    This is the summary, which should work for all operating systems (and will
    install all dependencies)

    2.1. Start R

    2.2. Copy and paste the following in the console:


    install.packages("Rcmdr")


    Press Enter.

    It might tell you (depending on operating systems and other settings
    and if you did not use the path we suggest) that the system library is
    not writable, and it will ask you if you want to install to a personal
    library. Say yes.
    
    It will ask your for a mirror. I find that the mirrors in Austria and
    Switzerland are often very reliable (more than the one in Madrid). So
    use a mirror from Switzerland or Austria.

    It will then download and install a bunch of things. It can take
    several minutes (about 5) with a fast internet connection on a
    computer from the last five years.

    If it ever asks "Do you want to install from sources the packages
    which need compilation?" say "No". THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT under 
	Windows!!


    2.3. When it is finished, in the R console do:
       
     library(Rcmdr)

     Press Enter. It will tell you there are missing dependencies ("The
     following packages used by Rcmdr are missing ...") and it will offer
     to install them. Allow it to install all the missing dependencies
     (the defaults in the window of "Install Missing Packages" should be
     fine; no need to touch anything; just press OK). This should take a
     couple minutes.

	 If it ever asks "Do you want to install from sources the packages
    which need compilation?" say "No". THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT this is very
	important under Windows!!


    2.4. Users of Mac: there are sometimes issues with Rcmdr if, say, X11
    is missing. Read the installation instructions for R commander given
    above.



    2.5. Please, try to use the most recent version of Rcmdr. How can you
    tell the version? Two ways:

    2.5.1 From R itself do "library(help  = Rcmdr)" and it will procude
    output that includes the Version number.

    2.5.1. From Rcmdr itself: go to "Help" and click on "About Rcmdr"



    2.6. Linux: some Linux distros ship pre-compiled versions of Rcmdr. So
    you might install Rmcdr this way. But beware that some Linux distros
    ship versions of Rcmdr that can be very outdated.

	

    2.7. Does the version of Rcmdr matter? Not a lot (assuming it is
    anything > 2.3), but newer versions have more functionality. 
    

   
    
 3. Install a few R commander plugins and additional packages.

    3.1. In the same R console (the R console, not the R commander window
    ---the R console is the console or window that oppened first when you
    started R, and it says "R console" at the top) session as before, copy
    and paste

    install.packages(c("RcmdrPlugin.TeachingDemos",
   "RcmdrPlugin.survival", "RcmdrPlugin.sos" , "RcmdrPlugin.HH",
   "RcmdrPlugin.mosaic", "RcmdrPlugin.plotByGroup", 
   "tkrplot", "doBy", "vcd", "ISwR"))


    and press Enter. That will download and install a few things (it
    should be done in a couple of minutes).

	If it ever asks "Do you want to install from sources the packages
    which need compilation?" say "No". THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT under
	Windows!!


    3.2. Exit R Commander and R. Under "File", in "R Commander", click on
    "Exit", and in there on "Exit From Commander and R"
   


 4. Install RStudio (www.rstudio.com). We want to use the "Desktop", that
    you can download from here:

    http://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/	


 
    4.1. Install RStudio. RStudio has new releases frequently, but
    anything with version 1.2.5000 should be more than enough.

    Of course, you want the RStudio for your operating system (Windows,
    Mac, whatever).

       4.1.1. Under Windows, you probably do not want to change the path
       (we changed it for R, but we don't change it for RStudio).


    4.2. Verify it works. Click on it and it should start, and you should
    see an application with an R console (along with two or three other
    windows).
 
    Under Windows, you might see a warning that sterror_s is not found. It
    seems inocuous: just type OK, and the thing will continue.

   

    4.3. Make sure everything works including R commander.

     4.3.1 In RStudio, go to the R console (the left panel or the
         bottom-left panel) and type
         library("Rcmdr")
 	
     4.3.2 Press enter.
       You should see a new window that says "R Commander", and no warning
       messages about missing dependencies. (Yes, it will say that it
       is loading blablabla, etc. But no errors or missing depedencies).

     4.3.3.If there are still missing dependencies, you should be given the
       option to install them by just clicking a button. Do so now.


       
       
      
5. Exit R Studio, RCommander, etc.

   5.1. In R Commander, go to "File", "Exit", "From commander"

   5.2. In RStudio go to "File", "Quit RStudio".

   5.3. (There are other ways of exiting, like simply going to RStudio and
    in the "File" menu clicking on "Quit R Studio". This looks abrupt and
    in Windows can give you worrying messages, but it is OK. Similar
    things can be done directly from R Commander, by exiting from "From
    Commander and R").


  5.4. If you get questions about "Save workspace image" just say "No".


6. Double check things work:

   6.1 Start RStudio.
   
   6.2 On the left or bottom-left panel type
       library(Rcmdr)

   6.3 When you get R Commander running, go to the menu and under "Tools",
   "Load Rcmdr plugin(s)" select all of them.

   6.4. You will get a message that says that the plugin will not be
   available until the Commander is restarted. Click Yes to restart the
   Commander.

   6.5. If everything worked, you can now exit. If things did not, retrace
   your steps or start all over and follow instructions carefully.

   6.6. (When you exit, RStudio might crash. Don't worry. And you were
   exiting anyway :-).
