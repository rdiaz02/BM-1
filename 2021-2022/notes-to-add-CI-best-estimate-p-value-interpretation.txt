- Dramatic example of incorrect interpretation of CI, p-value, and best estimate.

  - Sure, can have wide CI, but the fact that it includes 0 does not mean "the
    drug does not work". No statistical significance just means "not enough
    information"

  - Some great examples from Miguel Hernáns examples of trials of Tocilizumab.

    - he uses and OR, so 1 would be the equivalent of 0.

  - Hernán reminds us of Greenland's idea of using "Compatibility interval"
    instead of "Confidence interval".  


   - Slide Hernan-7.png: example of a huge CI (and huge p-value) and turning
     that, incorrectly, as evidence that something does not work. But the correct
     interpretation is that the trial is not informative at all. See the example
     with the huge CI. (Hernan-6.png)

     - See also Hernan-8.png for changes in estimates of the meta-analysis as new
       original studies accumulate.
