* Software installation:
  - First day of class, after they have wifi access

* General intro
  - Label forum posts appropriately: Lesson 1, Lesson 2, etc
  - Do not just read the notes: work through them (do exercises, repeat
    figures, etc)


** Mechanics and difficulties
  - You need to learn the concepts
  - You need to learn to do it (at least one program):
    - We choose one
  - Exam will focus MAINLY on concepts
    - We do not want to penalize you if you have some technical problem
      with R during the exam.
    - But the output you have to interpret will be output from R.


* Linear models
  - use examples of figures for representing large models. E.g., my plots
    of coefficientes in paper oncotrees, fig. 2 and 3.
  - what do I do with the "Lesson-3-add-example-of-balance" (in 2014-2015)


* t-test
  - fix the m3 object usage: it was created with the plugin. Create it in
    a different way!!
