Notes for basic statistics notions. We cover comparing two groups and a little bit of linear models. The
notes do not assume familiarity with R and we use R commander [R
Commander](http://socserv.mcmaster.ca/jfox/Misc/Rcmdr) as well as several
plugins for it. These notes cover similar material to those in
[R-basic-stats](https://github.com/rdiaz02/R-basic-stats), but the
audience is different (R-basic-stats does not use R commander).
